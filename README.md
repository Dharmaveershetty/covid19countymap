This project contains a crowdsourced map of health policy data, broken down by county. A visual interface to the data is available [here](https://hikmahealth.github.io/covid19countymap). All of the structured data can be downloaded from the [`gh-pages` branch](https://github.com/hikmahealth/covid19countymap/tree/gh-pages), while all of the code to process the data is available as jupyter/colab notebooks on the master branch.
