Our team from Hikma Health is crowdsourcing and producing a structured dataset with visualizations to encode and represent the social policies enacted for COVID-19 response. This project includes the following components:
 
1. A novel user interface to capture crowdsourced policies by US county. [Adesh Kadambi, Melecia Wright, Henry Ashworth]
2. Open-source data on county-level policies into a single file suitable for data science use. [Dani Kiyasseh, Tara Pattilachan]
3. A US map based user interface for visualizing county-level data. [Ali Ebrahim, Adesh Kadambi, Senan Ebrahim]

The map can be viewered [here](https://hikmahealth.github.io/covid19countymap). 

The frontend system is still a work in progress and has been conceptualized with the wireframes below:

1. Landing page for the web application.
