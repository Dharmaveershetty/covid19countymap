Overview
--------

This project contains a crowdsourced map of health policy data, broken down by county. A visual interface to the data is available [here](https://hikmahealth.github.io/covid19countymap). All of the structured data can be downloaded from the [`gh-pages` branch](https://github.com/hikmahealth/covid19countymap/tree/gh-pages), while all of the code to process the data is available as jupyter/colab notebooks on the master branch.

Cases counts displayed by county were obtained from the [New York Times dataset](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html).
